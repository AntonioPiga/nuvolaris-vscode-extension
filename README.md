# Nuvolaris VSCode Extension

This extensions automate login to Nuvolaris.dev and add an icon in the activity bar to open a command palette supporting the following commands:

- login
- devel
- deploy

Note: this extension requires the `nuv` tool and the Nuvolaris devcontainer and will not work standalone. Please fork a starter on `github.com/mastrogpt/*-starter` and open then in the devcontainer to use it.
